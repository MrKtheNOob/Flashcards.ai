make an edit video and a tutorial video in your youtube channel for the AIflashcard app
we are making views with this one  
I want to make the home page 
big ass label with a picture and then a big message saying utilisez le pouvoir de l'ia 
pour m√©moriser rapisement vos lecons -done
and then a cute button in blue with rounded sides to make an account 
use your alert component to signal that request went wrong
the responsivity of the menu is ass 
slacking off is bad 
for 4 days I was messed up watching anime during the day and playing meaningless games
and going to this useless meeting draining my entire energy and fucking up my mental schedules
I am not doing this again except it has meaning otherwise fuck off
now I need to make a white night to makes this up cuz of the sterss of the day and theses motherfucing npcs

I can put keybinds for pc so that they don't need to use the mouse to turn and navigate throught the cards
oh my days this came up just now : put math keyboard to add math to he flashcards so that people can put math in
there falshcards and learn formulas
I need a functionality to stop the request to generate flashcards
gonna have to be using ctx for that

Imma need to add the possibility to create a new deck from the aigenerate menu
so that man can save the new cards in a a new deck
I don't know where you put the form data but it is useless cuz its not even a form
just send it through json like everything
we have a loading animation now , put it everywhere

when the user registers, that operation takes time, add a loading animation there
Holy crap .If I knew the first thing I would do is this stupid authentication+ testing the .env things
database shema and auth are the first thing that should be sorted before doing anything else
new project , I'm gonna work out the entire backend first before thinking about the frontend
when response is 401 then navigate to the auth page to log in
if the user goes to /decks and it is not logged in it should g back to the auth page
change the options request handlers to take handlePreflightRequest instead
when you see a problem with a route ,compare it to another route that does about the same job 
put the link pointing to the page on the navbar

I am so dumb , when the user goes from flashcards menu to exercice , instead of fetching the falshcards data 2 times
make exercice take those flashcards as a prop to the exercice component

make the decks responsive in the create with AI page
we are so close to finshing this thing 
make sure the loading animation are on point 
verify the delete card feature ,there seem to be some cors issue perhaps
verify if the user is redirected to the aut page if not logged in from the gen ai page 

i think that's it 
build it and deploy as beta 
we'll see
My ego is so high rn 
I need to make it ,deploy it so that its satisfied 
I need to finish this
no wonder I can't sleep lately 
I have way more to learn in backend
I need to go deep into these middleware,context stuff
I could be excelent in golang and then market myself as is very good golang while explaining how good and 
better golang is compared to yava

I don't care ... A user can create 2 decks of the same name and its gonna corrupt the edit flashcard function
